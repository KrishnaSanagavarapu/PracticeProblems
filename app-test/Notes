Topic 1

Modules - ang application is a collection of modules

modules consist of component and services

Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template.

root component, app component

architecture -> one or more modules
modules -> one or more components
module- can also have services


package.json - dev dependencies

main.ts -> entry pont to angular application

app comp - root

we will kick start the app modules in main.ts

templateURl and template - we can write the code
	back tickets and write all html code


Topic 4

// angular templates - event binding , property binding

Angular interpolation

to make dynamic data -
create. a new property to class and assign the data

{{ name }}

simplest way to bind data from class to template

->  expressions that are used in the interpolation
-> string concatenation “welcome”+hello
 -> Using js properties  name.length
-> methods can be used in the interpolation  name.uppercase
-> methods defined in components

things that cannot do

assign expression to results variable
access to global variables  - windows.location.href
public siteUrl = window.location.href;
{{ siteUrl}}



** Property Binding in Angular

what is the diff html attribute and DOM element


$0.getAttribute(‘value’)
$0.value


attribute vs property vs property binding vs event binding vs attribute binding vs interpolation
vs decorator
vs providers


attributes - html - values cannot change
properties - DOM - values can change

limitation to interpolation - it can only work for string , not for boolean
for this solution, we need to do property binding

[ ].  [bind-disabled]


** Class binding

we have to use one or other, not both of them. class , [class]

what if we need to apply with multiple classes

ng class Directives - custom HTML attribute that Angular provides

[ngClass] =  “messsageClasses”
this will verify for all the classes

it will dynamical y add or remove

** Style Binding
